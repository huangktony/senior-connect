# 🌟 Overview

Opal is a community-driven mobile app designed to help **seniors**, **caretakers**, and **verified volunteers** coordinate essential daily tasks.  
Built using **React Native (Expo)**, **Firebase**, **Flask**, and **Gemini**, Opal blends accessibility, safety, and AI-powered assistance into a seamless platform that strengthens communities.

# 🧩 The Problem

Millions of seniors struggle with everyday tasks — from chores and errands to reminders and check-ins.  
Caretakers are overburdened. Volunteers are available, but there's **no trusted system** that safely connects them.

**Opal solves this by creating a secure, intelligent, and transparent task marketplace for senior support.**
